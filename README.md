# Edelweiss
Edelweiss is a miniature Electronic Medical Record (EMR) that allows physicians to retrieve patient information
and create prescriptions and appointments.

Edelweiss is named for a flower native to Germany that has medicinal properties and is a symbol of dedication when
given to a loved one. It is also named in honor of the Edelweiss Pirates, 
a group of young men and women in Germany who opposed the Third Reich.
